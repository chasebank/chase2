# This is an h1. Probably not super common as this is actually the body of the article.

There is gonna be [a link right here](http://google.com), followed by a little **bold text**. Then we'll probably get a little nasty and do some _italic_ and maybe a little **_bold and italic_** just for kicks.

## This is an h2

### This is an h3 it is very long so it wraps and we can check the line-height and [stuff](#) like that

#### This is an h4

Here's some `code`:

```css
body {
  background: red;
}
```

##### This is an h5

<dl>
  <dt>How much wood would a wood chuck chuck?</dt>
  <dd>Some</dd>
</dl>

###### This is an h6

h6 should be the same size as body type.

<p>I started working on a CodePen toy that needs constantly updated mouse coordinates to provide some special feedback to User. Sure, this is no big deal to make The JavaScripts do this, but now I'm a <code>var(--princess)</code> and I don't want to use jQuery <em>(I just vurp'd a little)</em>, or Angular's ngWhatever patterns <em>(gross!)</em>, or vanilla JavaScript <em>(meh...)</em> — stuffing attributes on things and messing with the DOM <em>(ew!)</em>. I want CSS to do it!</p>
