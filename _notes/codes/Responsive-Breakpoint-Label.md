It's using the `content` property of a pseudo element on the body, so adding additional labels is easy. And it's maintained entirely in CSS so it can be turned on/off with a simple `display: none`.

This can also be done right in Chrome's Dev Tools, but when designing in the browser early on, something like this can help for a constant quick reference.
